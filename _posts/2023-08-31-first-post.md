To say the least, every step of setting up this blog was very new to me. It was also somewhat of a struggle to prepare this blog due to me being relatively new to all the software for webpages and websites. The installation process for Ruby and Jekyll was very confusing, and it took me a while to understand that I had to install them via using the terminal.
