While styling a webpage sounds like a simple task, there were many challenges that I ran into, which include, but are not limited to:

- Organization
    - <span style="color:orange"> When writing down the code for styling, it is very important to understand how everything is organized. 
    Early on, I realized that if I wanted to have any hope of debugging my code in an efficient way, then I have to keep everything organized</span>. 
   
- Creativity 
    - <span style="color:orange">It took some time, trial and error, and research to figure out what I wanted to do, and if it was even possible for me to do it</span>.

- General Understanding of the Coding Languages being Used. 
    - <span style="color:orange">Of course, all of these coding languages are new to me. So, I had to spend a great amount of time
    doing research about [style](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35465557/how-to-apply-color-on-text-in-markdown), [formatting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecatalyst/latest/userguide/issues-markdown-tips.html), and other [important things](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41604263/how-do-i-display-local-image-in-markdown) </span>.
