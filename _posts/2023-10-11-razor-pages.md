For lab 8, I had to use ASP.net Razor Pages to record something of my interest. The hardest part about this lab was understanding how each step of the tutorial affected the website I was building. Once I finished the tutorial, it was very easy to implement my website using Razorpages by referring to the code and steps in the tutorial. 

A specific challenge I faced was adapting the code from the second step of the tutorial into my own models and code.  

One of the biggest parallels I see between the Jekyll and Razorpages implementation is that the frame work of the website is already layed out, thus the changes being made by the developer does not involve the structure of the website. The biggest difference between Jekyll and Razorpages is that Razorpages is more hands on, and there are more impactful changes going on beyond creating a post, or changing a title.
