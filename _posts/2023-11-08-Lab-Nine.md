For Lab 9, I had to complete the Razor Pages with Entity Framework Core tutorial from Microsoft then add onto the Grade enum, the student fields, create a new sorting mechanism for that field, and rename the website. 

The first part of the lab, following the tutorial, was very difficult at times. I had to learn about new errors, such as ambiguity errors, to find out what was wrong. Other than the occasional error, the tutorial was easy to complete, and I was able to gain a better understanding of how data tables interact with each other in a website. 

The hardest part of the second part of this lab was figuring out that I needed to do a migration to add another field to "Student". Once this was done, I was mainly making minor changes to the framework, where I went to every ".cshtml" or ".cs" file within "Students" to create a way for the user to interact with the age field. The Grade enum was extremely easy to interact with, and changing the name was also not difficult. 

Overall, this lab deepened my understanding of how data models interact with each other in the setting of a website and how migrations work when adding new data to a website.
