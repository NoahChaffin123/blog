**Skills and Talents in Social Change Work:**

Our collaborative effort to construct a functional seating chart for Hendrix College's Commencement required a fusion of various skills and talents. The ability to navigate web development tools, effective communication, and attention to detail emerged as paramount in our social change work. This experience illuminated the importance of recognizing and leveraging individual talents within a team setting, reinforcing the idea that collective skills propel social change.

**Effectiveness of Social Change Approaches:**

Delving into the social, environmental, and spiritual nuances of the project, we contemplated the efficacy of our approaches in creating change for the Commencement event. Collaborating with our community partners, we navigated the delicate balance between tradition and innovation. While the creation of a digital seating chart might seem like a subtle change, it symbolizes a shift towards efficiency and inclusivity. Witnessing the positive response from the Hendrix community affirmed the value of our work. It raised important questions about the role of technology in fostering social change and underscored the impact of seemingly small innovations in a broader context.

**Challenged or Confirmed Values and Beliefs:**

As the pixels aligned on our digital seating chart, so too did my thoughts on fundamental values and beliefs. The intersection of technology and tradition prompted a reevaluation of my perspectives. The delicate dance between embracing change and honoring tradition challenged my preconceptions. It reinforced the notion that social change is not a linear journey but a dynamic process where adaptability is key. My academic coursework provided a theoretical foundation, but it was this hands-on experience that truly tested and refined my beliefs.

**Reshaping Views on Public Issues:**

This Odyssey project served as a compass, guiding me through the labyrinth of public issues that beckon for action. The immersive nature of our work prompted a nuanced understanding of the broader implications of community engagement. It reshaped my views on the power of collaboration and technology in addressing societal needs. This experience ignited a sense of responsibility, fueling my commitment to actively contribute to future projects that aim to make a meaningful impact on society.
