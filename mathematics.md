The college level math courses I have taken so far are Calculus I, Calculus II, Multi-Variable Calculus, and Linear Algebra. I am currently taking Discrete Mathematics and Introduction to Advanced Mathematics. Introduction to Advanced Mathematics is a class where the students strive to understand the proofs and foundations of mathematics.
